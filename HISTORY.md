# Release 0.36.0

## Breaking changes

0.36.0 introduces a new Gibbs sampler. It's been included in several previous releases as `Turing.Experimental.Gibbs`, but now takes over the old Gibbs sampler, which gets removed completely.

The new Gibbs sampler currently supports the same user-facing interface as the old one, but the old constructors have been deprecated, and will be removed in the future. Also, given that the internals have been completely rewritten in a very different manner, there may be accidental breakage that we haven't anticipated. Please report any you find.

`GibbsConditional` has also been removed. It was never very user-facing, but it was exported, so technically this is breaking.

The old Gibbs constructor relied on being called with several subsamplers, and each of the constructors of the subsamplers would take as arguments the symbols for the variables that they are to sample, e.g. `Gibbs(HMC(:x), MH(:y))`. This constructor has been deprecated, and will be removed in the future. The new constructor works by mapping symbols, `VarName`s, or iterables thereof to samplers, e.g. `Gibbs(x=>HMC(), y=>MH())`, `Gibbs(@varname(x) => HMC(), @varname(y) => MH())`, `Gibbs((:x, :y) => NUTS(), :z => MH())`. This allows more granular specification of which sampler to use for which variable.

Likewise, the old constructor for calling one subsampler more often than another, `Gibbs((HMC(0.01, 4, :x), 2), (MH(:y), 1))` has been deprecated. The new way to do this is to use `RepeatSampler`, also introduced at this version: `Gibbs(@varname(x) => RepeatSampler(HMC(0.01, 4), 2), @varname(y) => MH())`.

# Release 0.35.0

## Breaking changes

Julia 1.10 is now the minimum required version for Turing.

Tapir.jl has been removed and replaced with its successor, Mooncake.jl.
You can use Mooncake.jl by passing `adbackend=AutoMooncake(; config=nothing)` to the relevant samplers.

Support for Tracker.jl as an AD backend has been removed.

# Release 0.33.0

## Breaking changes

The following exported functions have been removed:

  - `constrained_space`
  - `get_parameter_bounds`
  - `optim_objective`
  - `optim_function`
  - `optim_problem`

The same functionality is now offered by the new exported functions

  - `maximum_likelihood`
  - `maximum_a_posteriori`

# Release 0.30.5

  - `essential/ad.jl` is removed, `ForwardDiff` and `ReverseDiff` integrations via `LogDensityProblemsAD` are moved to `DynamicPPL` and live in corresponding package extensions.
  - `LogDensityProblemsAD.ADgradient(ℓ::DynamicPPL.LogDensityFunction)` (i.e. the single argument method) is moved to `Inference` module. It will create `ADgradient` using the `adtype` information stored in `context` field of `ℓ`.
  - `getADbackend` function is renamed to `getADType`, the interface is preserved, but packages that previously used `getADbackend` should be updated to use `getADType`.
  - `TuringTag` for ForwardDiff is also removed, now `DynamicPPLTag` is defined in `DynamicPPL` package and should serve the same [purpose](https://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/improved-forwarddiff-jl-stacktraces-with-package-tags/).

# Release 0.30.0

  - [`ADTypes.jl`](https://github.com/SciML/ADTypes.jl) replaced Turing's global AD backend. Users should now specify the desired `ADType` directly in sampler constructors, e.g., `HMC(0.1, 10; adtype=AutoForwardDiff(; chunksize))`, or `HMC(0.1, 10; adtype=AutoReverseDiff(false))` (`false` indicates not to use compiled tape).
  - Interface functions such as `ADBackend`, `setadbackend`, `setadsafe`, `setchunksize`, and `setrdcache` are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
  - Removed the outdated `verifygrad` function.
  - Updated to a newer version of `LogDensityProblemsAD` (v1.7).

# Release 0.12.0

  - The interface for defining new distributions with constrained support and making them compatible with `Turing` has changed. To make a custom distribution type `CustomDistribution` compatible with `Turing`, the user needs to define the method `bijector(d::CustomDistribution)` that returns an instance of type `Bijector` implementing the `Bijectors.Bijector` API.
  - `~` is now thread-safe when used for observations, but not assumptions (non-observed model parameters) yet.
  - There were some performance improvements in the automatic differentiation (AD) of functions in `DistributionsAD` and `Bijectors`, leading to speeds closer to and sometimes faster than Stan's.
  - An `HMC` initialization bug was fixed. `HMC` initialization in Turing is now consistent with Stan's.
  - Sampling from the prior is now possible using `sample`.
  - `psample` is now deprecated in favour of `sample(model, sampler, parallel_method, n_samples, n_chains)` where `parallel_method` can be either `MCMCThreads()` or `MCMCDistributed()`. `MCMCThreads` will use your available threads to sample each chain (ensure that you have the environment variable `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` set to the number of threads you want to use), and `MCMCDistributed` will dispatch chain sampling to each available process (you can add processes with `addprocs()`).
  - Turing now uses `AdvancedMH.jl` v0.5, which mostly provides behind-the-scenes restructuring.
  - Custom expressions and macros can be interpolated in the `@model` definition with `$`; it is possible to use `@.` also for assumptions (non-observed model parameters) and observations.
  - The macros `@varinfo`, `@logpdf`, and `@sampler` are removed. Instead, one can access the internal variables `_varinfo`, `_model`, `_sampler`, and `_context` in the `@model` definition.
  - Additional constructors for `SMC` and `PG` make it easier to choose the resampling method and threshold.

# Release 0.11.0

  - Removed some extraneous imports and dependencies ([#1182](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/pull/1182))
  - Minor backend changes to `sample` and `psample`, which now use functions defined upstream in AbstractMCMC.jl ([#1187](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/pull/1187))
  - Fix for an AD-related crash ([#1202](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/pull/1202))
  - StatsBase compat update to 0.33 ([#1185](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/pull/1185))
  - Bugfix for ReverseDiff caching and memoization ([#1208](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/pull/1208))
  - BREAKING: `VecBinomialLogit` is now removed. Also `BernoulliLogit` is added ([#1214](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/pull/1214))
  - Bugfix for cases where dynamic models were breaking with HMC methods ([#1217](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/pull/1217))

# Release 0.10.1

  - Fix bug where arrays with mixed integers, floats, and missing values were not being passed to the `MCMCChains.Chains` constructor properly [#1180](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/pull/1180).

# Release 0.10.0

  - Update elliptical slice sampling to use [EllipticalSliceSampling.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/EllipticalSliceSampling.jl) on the backend. [#1145](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/pull/1145). Nothing should change from a front-end perspective -- you can still call `sample(model, ESS(), 1000)`.
  - Added default progress loggers in [#1149](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/pull/1149).
  - The symbols used to define the AD backend have changed to be the lowercase form of the package name used for AD. `forward_diff` is now `forwarddiff`, `reverse_diff` is now `tracker`, and `zygote` and `reversediff` are newly supported (see below). `forward_diff` and `reverse_diff` are deprecated and are slated to be removed.
  - Turing now has experimental support for Zygote.jl ([#783](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/pull/783)) and ReverseDiff.jl ([#1170](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/pull/1170)) AD backends. Both backends are experimental, so please report any bugs you find. Zygote does not allow mutation within your model, so please be aware of this issue. You can enable Zygote with `Turing.setadbackend(:zygote)` and you can enable ReverseDiff with `Turing.setadbackend(:reversediff)`, though to use either you must import the package with `using Zygote` or `using ReverseDiff`. `for` loops are not recommended for ReverseDiff or Zygote -- see [performance tips](https://turinglang.org/dev/docs/using-turing/performancetips#special-care-for-codetrackercode-and-codezygotecode) for more information.
  - Fix MH indexing bug [#1135](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/pull/1135).

  - Fix bug in VI where the bijectors where being inverted incorrectly [#1168](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/pull/1168).
  - The Gibbs sampler handles state better by passing `Transition` structs to the local samplers ([#1169](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/pull/1169) and [#1166](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl/pull/1166)).
