# About

This is a starter template for a mkdocs jekyll theme, based on these two
previous beauties:

 - [alexcarpenter/material-jekyll-theme](http://alexcarpenter.github.io/material-jekyll-theme)
 - [squidfunk/mkdocs-material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material)

Specifically, I wanted a completely jekyll-based template that would render
markdown docs, deployed on GitHub pages, and set up with easy customization
and preview.
