I"º<p>In this section, I will describe the current design of Turingâ€™s model compiler which enables Turing to perform various types of Bayesian inference without changing the model definition. What we call â€œcompilerâ€ is essentially just a macro that transforms the userâ€™s code to something that Juliaâ€™s dispatch can operate on and that Juliaâ€™s compiler can successfully do type inference on for efficient machine code generation.</p>
